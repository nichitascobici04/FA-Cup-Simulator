# FA Cup Simulator

Hi there! This is my pet project, a small Python script that aims to determine the winners of possible FA Cup matches using the Elo rating system. The general idea for something like this was on my mind for a long time but at the end of September 2025, instead of studying for college, a clear vision popped into my head of how all of this should work so I coded most of this in a 3-4 hours evening session beacause I wanted to turn my idea into code as soon as possible. I know the code is not very readable, or scalable, or clean so my main focus for the next commits will be refacturing the code. I eventually want to recreate this logic in C++ and make a more developed version of this project and maybe make an interactive web application at some point. Thankfully, I have plenty of feature ideas for further developing the app in the way I want to be. 

If you somehow find my repository, you're a legend! Feel free to test the script, change the code as you like and make your own version of the project. Any ideas or suggestions are warmly welcomed :D
 
Sincerely, nixsrev
